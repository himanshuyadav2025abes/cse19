        <p>Blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block, forming a chain. Blockchain technology is the backbone of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend beyond digital currencies to include supply chain management, voting systems, and more.</p>
